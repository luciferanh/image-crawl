# image-crawl
Your favorite is reading comic and you can code . If wifi is weak , you can crawl web to down image
i try to download images in http://truyentranhtam.com/kemono-giga-chap-1 
If you want to upload a lot of images to your computer, fix the code so that the file created in the folder doesn't have the same name
You can use javascript , python or C# to crawl web
